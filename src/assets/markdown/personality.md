### Personality

Since childhood, I've been told that I have a **constant thirst for knowledge,** the ability to learn quickly in areas that interest me, and **hate routine affairs**. Usually, I immediately get everybody's attention and recognition, make friends quickly, and as far as I know no one thinks I’m a jerk. According to the "16 personalities" test, I am ["debater"](https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/0748e79e8a572), which I think is a good description of my character.

I **don't like anything that is obvious,** no matter what it is ― movie, song or even a joke. Everything should trigger mental activity. Therefore, **I love to solve tasks** and for me, the best gift is a puzzle or a book. For over 8 years, my first and only love, who eventually became **my wife**, is the biggest **inspiration of my life**.

I respect people who believe that **knowledge is not personal property** and who want to share it with others, and in that reason, **I'm writing articles** to [Medium](https://medium.com/@alexandrtovmach), [Habr](https://habr.com/ru/users/alexandrtovmach/posts/), [DOU](https://dou.ua/users/aleksandr-tovmach/articles), and in addition help with documentation for several projects, like a Node.js, Gatsby.js and SemVer.
