### Ambitions

I wasn't even 14 when I dreamt of becoming **an archaeologist** to answer the questions of the evolution of species, **an inventor** of spacecraft to expand the boundaries of accessible space, and **a chemist,** to solve the environmental problems of our planet. I always wanted **to change this world for the better,** and that's why Iâ€™m now engaged in programming to create things that, even if they (still) don't save lives, at least improve them.

I believe that **masterpieces are created from pure enthusiasm**, and not for money, therefore I am open source evangelist and an open-minded adventurer.
